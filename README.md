## Virtual environment
- created via the command python3 -m venv .venv
- To activate it on MacOs, use `source .venv/bin/activate`
- Once the virtual environment is activated, any Python commands or scripts you run will use the Python interpreter and packages installed in that environment, keeping your project isolated from the global Python environment.
- Install dependencies defined in requirements.txt by using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
